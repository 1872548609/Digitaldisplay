&par Example Description

Through The computer of serial debugging assistant, display the message sent
and received between the MCU and USART1.

The phenomenon of serial assistant can display information from USART1.

  - USART1(TX:PA9, RX:PA10) configured as follow:
  - BaudRate    = 115200
  - Word Length = USART_WordLength_8b
  - Stop Bit    = USART_StopBits_1
  - Parity      = USART_Parity_No
  - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
  - Receive and transmit enabled

USART2(PA2, PA3) and USART3(PB10, PB11) configured as follow:
  - BaudRate    =   115200 baud
  - Word Length =   USART_WordLength_8b
  - Stop Bit    =   USART_StopBits_1
  - Parity      =   USART_Parity_No
  - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
  - Receive and transmit enabled

    USART2       USART3
      PA2  ---->  PB11
      PA3  ---->  PB10
