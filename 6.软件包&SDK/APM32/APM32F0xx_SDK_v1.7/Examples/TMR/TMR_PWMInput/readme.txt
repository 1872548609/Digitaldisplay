&par Example Description

This example describes how to use TMR3 Channel_2 (PE4 for APM32F072 | PA7 for APM32F030) measure frequency and duty cycle of external signa. User can view the "DutyCycle" "Frequency "value through serial termainal.

TMR3_IRQHandler Function to calculate:
DutyCycle =  (TMR3_CC1*100)/(TMR3_CC2)  %.
Frequency = (RCM_ReadHCLKFreq()/2) / (TMR3_CC2) Hz.
The minimum frequency value to measure is 1 Hz.

&par Hardware Description

using USART1(TX:PA9, RX:PA10).
  - USART2 configured as follow:
  - BaudRate    =   115200
  - Word Length =   USART_WordLength_8b
  - Stop Bit    =   USART_StopBits_1
  - Parity      =   USART_Parity_No
  - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
  - Receive and transmit enabled

  - using TMR3 CHANNEL2(PE4 for APM32F072 | PA7 for APM32F030) connect the external signal
